# Psgc(Philippine Standard Geographic Code) Ruby

The Philippine Standard Geographic Code (PSGC) is a systematic classification
and coding of geographic areas of the Philippines.

It is based on the four well-established hierarchical levels of
geographical-political subdivisions of the country such as the administrative
region, the province, the municipality/city and the barangay.

This Ruby gem provides the PSGC data as a Ruby class library. It can be used in
Rails applications without requiring dedicated database tables.

This gem also contains helper methods for mapping specific region's provinces
and province's cities and municipalities for much more productive development.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'psgc', git: "https://github.com/redjoker011/psgc"
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install psgc
